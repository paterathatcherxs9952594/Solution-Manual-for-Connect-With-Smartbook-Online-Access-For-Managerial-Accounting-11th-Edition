  * For centuries, the lighthouse has stood as a beacon of guidance for mariners at sea. More than an aid to navigation, the lighthouse symbolizes safety, permanence, reliability, and the comforts of the familiar. For this reason, we have chosen to illustrate the eleventh Canadian edition of our flagship Managerial Accounting publication by Garrison/Libby/Webb with a lighthouse image that encapsulates the greatest strengths of this market leading text.
  * Garrison guides students through the challenges of learning managerial accounting. It identifies the three functions managers must perform within their organizations―plan operations, control activities, and make decisions―and explains the accounting information necessary for these functions. The eleventh Canadian edition of Managerial Accounting continues to place an emphasis on three core qualities: relevance, balance and clarity.
